In the vast expanses of Eurasia for several centuries, the descendants of the great Genghis Khan have created their own and crushed the alien states.

Despite not having any legal documents, Binti wants to live a normal life, and dreams of becoming a famous vlogger like her idol Tatyana. Elias (11) runs his 'save-the-okapi-club' without the help of his father, who's moved to Brazil following his divorce with Elias’s mother Christine. When their annoying neighbour invites Christine on a romantic trip to Paris, Elias, upset and angry, runs away to his treehouse. At the same time, police raid Binti and Jovial’s home, sending the two on the run, and Binti into the path of Elias. When their parents meet shortly after, Binti quickly sees the perfect solution to all her problems. If she can match her dad with Elias’ mom, they can get married and stay in Belgium.",2.284,/9z0ROIFb5azNnM1vhwGyrbKvVsf.jpg,"[{'id': 54850, 'logo_path': '/kcZniXFtwC4vE3YqK7TRrovzxVA.png', 'name': 'Bulletproof Cupid', 'origin_country': 'BE'}, {'id': 26389, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Family Affair Films', 'origin_country': ''}, {'id': 104097, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Kwassa Films', 'origin_country': 'BE'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'BE', 'name': 'Belgium'}]",2019-04-03,0.0,90.0,"[{'english_name': 'French', 'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'Français'}, {'english_name': 'Dutch', 'iso_639_1': 'nl', 'name': 'Nederlands'}]",Released,,Binti,0.0,6.8,5.0,

An elderly couple is celebrating their 50th anniversary, and family members gather at their once magnificent, now largely decrepit mansion, where they married a half-century before. As relatives young and old arrive and reminisce about their lives, stories are exchanged about the great family's past. But it does not take long to see that reality is more complicated than family myth. Long-buried family secrets inevitably arise as do secrets that may have been better kept locked away. To face the ""fading pride of a nebulous past,"" family closeness is needed now more than ever.
