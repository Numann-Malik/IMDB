But tragedy strikes when she loses the baby and sinks into a deep depression. Unbeknownst to Bill, Ashley decides that the only way for her to ""be"" with her miscarried child is to dabble in the South East Asian occult practice of raising her own ""ghost child"". She seeks the help of her Indonesian maid, Siti, tasking her to find a bomoh (witch doctor) who knows how to trap the spirit of unborn dead fetuses. Siti tries to dissuade Ashley from resorting to such dark magic but to no avail. In the meantime, in an effort to put the tragic events of the miscarriage behind them, Bill decides that it would be good for the couple to return home to Minnesota to start their lives over.
